# gccfilter

I've copied from the original gccfilter, of which the author is Emmanuel Le Trong, <manu@mixtion.org>.
The original gccfilter only supports unix-like paths, not Windows paths.
Because I'm developing the cross platform application which supports Windows, Linux(Ubuntu 16.04), and Mac OS X,
the revised gccfilter must support all of them.

For Windows, I'm using MinGW-W64 version. 
Microsoft Visual C++ compiler not supported.

The original copy can be obtained from http://www.mixtion.org/gccfilter/.
